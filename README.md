Four problems:

Text Highlight: This problem involves simulating a text highlighting feature by underlining keywords such as "for," "while," "int," etc., using underscores for each character of the keyword and spaces for non-keyword characters.

Autocomplete: Implement an autocomplete functionality that suggests words based on a mini-dictionary. Words are assigned priorities, and the user can either choose the recommended word or input their own, updating priorities accordingly.

Bitwise Calculator: Create a simple bitwise calculator that performs operations on 4-bit numbers. Operations include addition, swapping bits, left rotation, and XOR. Use a function pointer array for the operations.

Wordle Game with ncurses: Develop a graphical interface using ncurses for the Wordle game. The player guesses a 5-letter word in 6 attempts, with feedback on correct letters and positions. The game includes a menu for control options like restarting or exiting.
